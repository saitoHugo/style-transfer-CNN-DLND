## Style Transfer CNN

In this notebook, weâ€™ll *recreate* a style transfer method that is outlined in the paper, [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks, by Gatys](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) in PyTorch.

In this paper, style transfer uses the features found in the 19-layer VGG Network, which is comprised of a series of convolutional and pooling layers, and a few fully-connected layers. In the image below, the convolutional layers are named by stack and their order in the stack. Conv_1_1 is the first convolutional layer that an image is passed through, in the first stack. Conv_2_1 is the first convolutional layer in the *second* stack. The deepest convolutional layer in the network is conv_5_4.
